# Active Recon Assignment 4

This repository contains my Cybersecurity Internship **Assignment 4 – Active Recon & Web Enumeration**.

## Description
The assignment demonstrates controlled active reconnaissance on a target, using the following tools:  
- **Nmap** – Host discovery, port scanning, service/version detection, NSE scripts, OS fingerprinting  
- **DIRB** – HTTP directory brute-forcing  
- **WhatWeb** – Web fingerprinting  
- **Nikto** – Basic vulnerability scanning (non-exploitative)

## Files
- `ActiveRecon_Assignment4.pdf` – Full assignment report  

## Notes
- All scans were performed on authorized test targets only.  
- DNS resolution issue for OS detection required switching from domain to IP.
