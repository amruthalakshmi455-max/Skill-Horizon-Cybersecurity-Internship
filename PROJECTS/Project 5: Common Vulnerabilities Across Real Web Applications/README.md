# Project 5: Common Vulnerabilities Across Real Web Applications

## Overview
This project analyzes the File Upload vulnerability using Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA). It demonstrates how insecure file upload mechanisms can be exploited and connects these vulnerabilities with real-world CVEs.

## Vulnerability Chosen
- File Upload

## Platform Used
- Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)

## Environment
- OS: Kali Linux
- Web Application: DVWA

## Tools Used
- DVWA
- Burp Suite
- exiftool

## Key Learning
- File upload functionality is highly sensitive
- Extension-based validation is insufficient
- Improper file validation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Real-world vulnerabilities closely resemble DVWA scenarios
- Secure file handling requires multiple layers of defense
